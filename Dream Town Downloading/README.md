# ACNL Dream Town Downloading

Here's some useful scripts and tools for being able to download dream towns from a PC.
I've also provided details about the decryption process of dream towns.

This was a collaborative effort between Slattz, Cuyler, Waffer and WemI0 about a year ago. It's not user friendly and this version was never inteded to be released, so it's not for the end-user at all. This is mainly for people who are looking into this in the future; maybe it may be of some use to them. And people who know how to capture their 3ds packets but this isn't a tutorial, you're on your own in getting this working.

My Hard Drive with all my ACNL things corrupted recently, and this is all I had left. This is my last contribution to the ACNL Hacking scene.

Long live AC New Horizons :smile:
