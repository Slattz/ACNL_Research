# Spotpass in ACNL

ACNL has a variety of Spotpass features.

* Letters
* Happy Home Showcase Houses
* Presents/'Distributed Items'
* RVs

Each of these features have been utilised at some point in ACNL's lifespan.

The Spotpass RVs was a new feature added in the Welcome Amiibo update. Unfortunately, this feature has only ever been used in Japan for distrubuting `Holden` and `Filly` RVs. It has never been used in Europe or the USA.

In this repo I have provided some documentation on Spotpass files, and have also provided some sample Spotpass files. Unforunately, most of these are handcrafted and do not pass the checks Nintendo has put in place to ensure the Spotpass file was created by them. Thus, CFW is needed as it disables these checks. Spotpass files are also region and version locked, due to each version ACNL having it's own TitleID.

*However*, I have managed to capture one RV file. This file is specifically for the original Japanese version of ACNL. It is a capture of a 7-11 `Filly` event. This file was created by Nintendo, and so should also pass the checks and theoretically doesn't require CFW.
