# ACNL's HHS (Exhibition)

The Happy Home Showcase in ACNL allows players to visit the houses of other players. These houses appear in the HHS via Spotpass(depreciated) and Streetpass.

When the game first launched, Nintendo USA would send out regular houses belonging to Nintendo of America staff members, such as `Reggie`'s. A list can be found [here](http://thegeekescape.com/?p=6230).

Nintendo EUR only ever sent out one house, `Pikmin 3`. This house was just used to promote the release of Pikmin 3 on Wii U.

I'm currently unsure if Nintendo JPN ever sent out houses.

Included in this repo is a `exhibition.dat` save file, aswell as the individual house files.
This `exhibition.dat` save file includes the EUR `Pikmin 3`, aswell as the all USA houses.
The individual house files can be imported into your own exhibition.dat using [NLSE](https://github.com/WemI0/NLSE/releases/latest).
